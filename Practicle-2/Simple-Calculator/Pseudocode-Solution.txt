This is the pseudocode that I wrote to complete the following task:
	The program will ask for the user to enter two numbers and then display a menu with the following options:
		subtract, 
		multiply, 
		divide,
		addition,
		and output the results to screen.

Answer:

num1 = USERINPUT
num2 = USERINPUT
operator = USERINPUT
result = NONE

IF operator == 1 THEN
	result = num1 - num2

ELSE IF operator == 2 THEN
	result = num1 * num2

ELSE IF operator == 3 THEN
	result = num1 / num2

ELSE IF operator == 4 THEN
	result = num1 + num2

ELSE THEN
	OUTPUT "That is an illegal input, please try again"

OUTPUT result
